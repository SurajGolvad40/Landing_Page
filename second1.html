<div class="panel">
  <p> <h1 align="left" text><font size="25" face="Algerian" color="yellow">History of Technology</font></h1>
<h2 align="center"><font color="white"><li>The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques and is one of the categories of the history of humanity.<li>Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as stone tools to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s.</li>
<li>The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.</li></h2></font></ol><br>

<button class="accordion">Philosophy</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><h1 align="left"><font size="25" face="Algerian" color="yellow">Philosophy</font></h1>
<h2 align="center"><font color="white"><ul><li>If philosophy is the attempt �to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term�, as Sellars (1962) put it, philosophy should not ignore technology.</li>
<li>It is largely by technology that contemporary society hangs together.</li> It is hugely important not only as an economic force but also as a cultural force. <li>Indeed during the last two centuries, when it gradually emerged as a discipline, philosophy of technology has mostly been concerned with the meaning of technology for, and its impact on, society and culture, rather than with technology itself. Mitcham (1994) calls this type of philosophy of technology �humanities philosophy of technology� because it accepts �the primacy of the humanities over technologies� and is continuous with the overall perspective of the humanities (and some of the social sciences).</li>
<li>Only recently a branch of the philosophy of technology has developed that is concerned with technology itself and that aims to understand both the practice of designing and creating artifacts (in a wide sense, including artificial processes and systems) and the nature of the things so created.</li></ul></h2></font>  </p>

<button class="accordion">Engineering</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><h1 align="left" text><font size="25" face="Algerian" color="yellow">Engineering</font></h1></li>
<h3 align="center"><font color="white"><ol><li>An engineering technologist (eTechnologist) is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of technology. </li>
<li>Engineering technology education is even more applied and less theoretical than engineering education, though in a broad sense both have a focus on practical application. Engineering technologists often assist professional engineers but after years of experience, they can also work with engineers.</li>
<li>Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists can work include product design (including improvement), fabrication and testing. Also as with engineers, engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.</li></h3></font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="white"><ul><li>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical artificial intelligence that demonstrates a human-like ability to learn. AGI is a machine which could do all human activities with the efficiency of a machine. </li>
<li>It is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and a common topic among science fiction writers and futurists. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as strong AI, full AI or one that has the ability to perform "general intelligent action"</li><li>AGI is associated with traits such as consciousness, sentience, sapience, and self-awareness, which are observed in living beings. Some examples of hypothetical technology are flying cars, jetpacks, teleportation or robot helpers.</li></h3></font>
